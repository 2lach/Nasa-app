## Nasa viewer app with login, authentication and lots of fun stuff

#### I decided to use the MERN stack for this project
##### M - MongoDB, E - Express, R - React, N - Node.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


The rest i put together myself of course there where some research and inspiration involved for that i give cred to:
djamware, AmberWilkie, DanielDeutch and some more people who wrote pretty sweet stuff on the topics i needed to learn.

setup:

prequsits:
node.js installed on computer
`git clone "this repo"`<br/>

cd into root of project
`npm install`

then you need to create an .env file containing
`MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://a-url-that-works-with-mongo`<br/>
`PORT=1234`or it defaults too 3000 <br/>
`SECRET=something very secret` for the Authentication process
<br/>
when that is done open terminal cd into root of project and run the cmd:<br/>
`npm start` <br/>
this will compile the project and when it is done open your browser to:<br/>
`http://localhost:3000` or the port you entered in the .env file
<br/>
create a user, login and get goin look at them pretty pictures and stuff
